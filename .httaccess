To achieve clean URLs and hide file extensions using .htaccess, you can use mod_rewrite in Apache to rewrite the URLs. Here's an example of what your .htaccess file might look like to achieve the desired result:

RewriteEngine On

# Check if mod_rewrite is enabled
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

    # Rewrite only if the requested file is not a directory
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

    # Rewrite only if the requested file is not a regular file
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

    # Handle /login/ and redirect to index.php
    RewriteRule ^login/?$ index.php [NC,L]

    # Handle /signup/ and redirect to signup.php
    RewriteRule ^signup/?$ signup.php [NC,L]

    # Optionally, hide .php extension for all files
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.php -f
    RewriteRule ^(.+?)/?$ $1.php [NC,L]

</IfModule>
